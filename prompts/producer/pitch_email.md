# Pitch Email Composition

## Purpose

Create an email that accompanies concept materials and explains why these specific concepts matter to this specific brand.

## The Philosophy

The pitch email is not a summary. It's a strategic argument. It must:

1. **Demonstrate research** - Show you've done homework
2. **Make a strategic connection** - Link concepts to their priorities
3. **Create intrigue** - Tease without giving everything away
4. **Lower barriers** - Make it easy to say yes to a conversation

## Email Structure

### Subject Line
Format: `Three video concepts for [Company Name] — addressing [key challenge/opportunity]`

The challenge/opportunity should be specific to their situation, not generic.

**Good**: "Three video concepts for Nike — capturing the next generation of runners"
**Bad**: "Three video concepts for Nike — increasing brand awareness"

### Opening Paragraph
- Reference specific observation from research
- Show you understand their situation
- Don't be sycophantic, be insightful

**Template**:
```
I've been studying [Company Name]'s recent marketing activities and strategic direction, 
and I noticed [specific observation that shows homework].
```

**Example**:
```
I've been studying Patagonia's recent marketing activities and strategic direction,
and I noticed that while your sustainability credentials are industry-leading,
your content strategy hasn't yet found a way to make that story as shareable
as your products are wearable.
```

### Concept Introductions
For each concept (keep brief):
- Title in bold
- One sentence on what it is
- One sentence on why it addresses their priority

**Template**:
```
**Concept 1: "[Title]"**
[What it is] + [Why it matters to them]
```

**Example**:
```
**Concept 1: "The Repair Shop"**
A documentary series following Patagonia's repair technicians as they bring beloved
gear back to life—turning your sustainability philosophy into emotional storytelling
that audiences will actually seek out.
```

### Strategic Hypothesis (CRITICAL)
This is the intellectual core of the pitch. It explains:
- Why you chose these three specific concepts
- What strategic logic connects them
- Why this portfolio approach makes sense

**Template**:
```
The strategic hypothesis behind this outreach: [2-3 sentences explaining why you
believe these concepts would resonate with their current challenges/opportunities]
```

**Example**:
```
The strategic hypothesis behind this outreach: Based on my research, Patagonia has
an opportunity gap—your actions speak louder than your content. These three concepts
are designed to translate your genuine commitment to sustainability into compelling
entertainment that audiences choose to watch, creating authentic advocacy at scale.
```

### Close
- Simple ask for time
- Not pushy
- Specific enough to be actionable

**Template**:
```
I'd welcome 15 minutes to walk through these ideas and get your initial reactions.
```

### Signature
- Professional
- Include relevant credentials if applicable
- Link to materials
