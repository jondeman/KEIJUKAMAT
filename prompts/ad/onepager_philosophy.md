# One-Pager Philosophy

## The Purpose

A one-pager is not a summary. It's a sales tool.

Its job is to make someone who has 5 seconds of attention become someone who wants to learn more. Every element must contribute to this single goal.

## The Psychology

### Create Curiosity Gaps
Show enough to intrigue, not enough to satisfy. The viewer should finish with questions they want answered.

### Signal Quality
The quality of the one-pager signals the quality of the idea. A polished presentation suggests polished execution.

### Reduce Friction
Make it effortless to understand. Don't make them work to "get it."

### Inspire Imagination
Help them picture this concept existing. Make it feel real and possible.

## The Elements

### Headline (CRITICAL)
- 6 words or fewer
- Captures the essence
- Creates intrigue
- NOT a description ("A new video series")
- IS a promise ("Inside the Minds That Build Tomorrow")

### Subheadline
- 15 words or fewer
- Expands on the headline
- Adds context
- Can include the format/platform
- Starts answering "what is this?"

### Visual Center
- The hero image/graphic
- Sets the tone
- Creates emotional response
- Must be distinctive
- Avoid stock clichés

### Value Bullets
- 3-4 maximum
- Each 10 words or fewer
- Each starts with action/value
- Quick scannable benefits
- Mix of strategic and audience value

### Call to Action
- Clear next step
- Not salesy
- Suggests conversation
- Could be question or invitation

## The Layout

### Zones (9:16 vertical)

**Top Zone (15-20%)**
- Brand mark (subtle)
- Headline
- Maximum visual impact

**Middle Zone (50-60%)**
- Hero visual
- Concept visualization
- Emotional center

**Bottom Zone (25-30%)**
- Subheadline
- Value bullets
- Call to action
- More information density

### Principles

- Eyes flow top to bottom
- Most important info largest
- Create clear visual hierarchy
- Use whitespace intentionally
- Never let elements fight for attention

## The Brand Balance

The one-pager must feel like it could come from the brand while being obviously different from their current materials.

### Include
- Brand colors (primary and secondary)
- Tone-appropriate typography feel
- Professional aesthetic matching their tier

### Avoid
- Copying their exact templates
- Using only their primary color
- Making it look like their existing marketing

## Quality Indicators

A great one-pager:
- Could be printed and look great
- Works in both light and dark email clients
- Renders well on mobile
- Is immediately understandable
- Creates desire to learn more
- Feels premium and intentional
- Would not embarrass the brand

A bad one-pager:
- Looks generated/templated
