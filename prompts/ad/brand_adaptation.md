# Brand Adaptation Guidelines

## Purpose

Every one-pager must feel like it could belong to the brand's world while being clearly distinct from their existing materials. This document guides how to adapt generic one-pager designs to specific brand identities.

## Brand Analysis Process

### Step 1: Extract Visual DNA

From the Strategic Dossier, identify:

**Colors**
- Primary color (their main brand color)
- Secondary colors (supporting palette)
- Accent colors (highlights, CTAs)
- Background colors (what they typically use)

**Style Keywords**
These describe their visual personality:
- Corporate vs. Casual
- Traditional vs. Modern
- Playful vs. Serious
- Minimalist vs. Rich
- Tech-forward vs. Classic

**Tone Keywords**
These describe their emotional register:
- Confident, Bold, Dynamic
- Approachable, Friendly, Warm
- Premium, Exclusive, Sophisticated
- Innovative, Cutting-edge, Future-forward

### Step 2: Determine Adaptation Intensity

**Conservative Adaptation** (for traditional/corporate brands)
- Stay close to brand primary color
- Use clean, established design patterns
- Professional typography choices
- Subtle graphic elements
- High-end corporate aesthetic

**Moderate Adaptation** (for most brands)
- Use brand colors as foundation
- Add design flair appropriate to slot type
- Balance brand recognition with creative expression
- Push boundaries slightly while staying respectful

**Bold Adaptation** (for challenger brands or moonshot concepts)
- Use brand colors as accent rather than dominant
- More creative freedom in composition
- Can introduce complementary colors
- Focus on creating impact within brand spirit

### Step 3: Apply Brand Rules

**Color Application**
- Primary color: Headlines, key elements, or background
- Secondary: Supporting text, dividers, icons
- Accent: CTAs, highlights, emphasis points
- White/Black: Text contrast, spacing

**Typography Feel**
- Match their serif vs. sans-serif preference
- Match their weight preferences (bold vs. light)
- Match their density (compact vs. airy)
- Don't copy exact fonts, match the feeling

**Imagery Style**
- Photography vs. Illustration preference
- Realistic vs. Stylized
- Human-centered vs. Abstract
- Busy vs. Minimal

## Quality Check

Ask these questions:
1. Does this feel like it belongs to this brand's world?
2. Does this stand out as something new and exciting?
3. Would the brand be proud to share this?
4. Would a designer respect this adaptation?
5. Does it create desire while maintaining professionalism?
