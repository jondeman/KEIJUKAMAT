## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### In Prompts
- Being too vague ("make it look good")
- Over-specifying causing conflicts
- Forgetting text legibility requirements
- Requesting impossible combinations

### In Output
- Unreadable text
- Off-brand colors
- Stock photo clichés
- Cluttered composition
- Template aesthetics

## Prompt Enhancement Tips

### Add Specificity
Instead of: "professional look"
Use: "clean lines, minimal shadows, high-end corporate aesthetic like McKinsey or Apple keynotes"

### Reference Quality
Add: "The design quality should match top creative agencies like Pentagram or IDEO"

### Emphasize Readability
Add: "All text must be clearly legible with strong contrast against background"

### Prevent Clichés
Add: "Avoid generic stock photo aesthetics, handshake images, globe graphics, or light bulb metaphors"
