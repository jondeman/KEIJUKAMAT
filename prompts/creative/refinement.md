## Revision Guidelines

### For Strategic Issues

**Tension Alignment**
- Reread the strategic tension in the brief
- Make the connection explicit in the hook and premise
- Consider: How does this SOLVE the tension, not just acknowledge it?

**CMO Resonance**
- Lead with business impact, not creative description
- Use their language (ROI, market share, engagement, conversion)
- The first sentence a CMO reads should answer "Why should I care?"

**Differentiation**
- Research what the brand already does
- Find an angle they haven't explored
- Consider: What makes YOU uniquely suited to propose this?

### For Creative Issues

**Entertainment Value**
- Ask: Would I watch this if it weren't for work?
- Add stakes, conflict, or emotional hook
- Consider: What's the "can't look away" element?

**Format Specificity**
- Name exact durations, not ranges
- Specify production elements (host, location, equipment)
- Include enough detail for a producer to estimate cost

**Sustainability**
- Ensure episode concepts are genuinely diverse
- Show the concept can explore multiple angles
- Prove it's not a one-trick pony

### For Execution Issues

**Resource Reality**
- Match ambition to budget tier
- Consider: Can a 3-person team make this work?
- Remove elements that require exceptional resources

**Brand Integration**
- Find the brand's natural role in the content
- Reduce if too heavy, increase if too invisible
- Ask: Does the brand ADD value to the viewer experience?

**Platform Fit**
- Study successful content on the target platform
- Match length, pacing, and style to platform norms
- Consider: Would this get recommended by the algorithm?
