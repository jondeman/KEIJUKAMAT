# Self-Critique Criteria

Before finalizing any concept, evaluate it against these criteria. All must pass.

## Strategic Criteria

### 1. Tension Alignment
**Question**: Does this concept clearly address the assigned strategic tension?
**Pass**: The connection between tension and concept is obvious and direct.
**Fail**: The concept feels generic and could apply to any tension.

### 2. CMO Resonance
**Question**: Would a CMO immediately see the business value?
**Pass**: The hook makes the strategic benefit clear within one sentence.
**Fail**: Requires explanation of why this matters to business goals.

### 3. Differentiation
**Question**: Is this genuinely different from the brand's current content?
**Pass**: This approach is clearly distinct from what they already do.
**Fail**: This feels like a slight variation of existing efforts.

## Creative Criteria

### 4. Entertainment Value
**Question**: Would audiences choose this over other content?
**Pass**: There's a clear entertainment hook beyond brand interest.
**Fail**: This is only interesting if you already care about the brand.

### 5. Format Specificity
**Question**: Is the format specific enough to execute?
**Pass**: A producer could start pre-production from this document.
**Fail**: Major format decisions still need to be made.

### 6. Sustainability
**Question**: Can this concept sustain multiple episodes without fatigue?
**Pass**: The six episode concepts show variety and freshness.
**Fail**: The concept feels like a one-off stretched thin.

## Execution Criteria

### 7. Resource Reality
**Question**: Can this be produced with reasonable resources?
**Pass**: Budget tier and complexity are achievable for the brand.
**Fail**: This requires capabilities/budget beyond reasonable scope.

### 8. Brand Integration
**Question**: Does the brand presence feel natural?
**Pass**: Brand adds value without disrupting entertainment.
**Fail**: Brand integration feels forced or advertising-like.

### 9. Platform Fit
**Question**: Is this optimized for the primary platform?
**Pass**: Format matches platform-native viewing behaviors.
**Fail**: Format fights against platform conventions.

## Scoring

Each criterion is PASS or FAIL. The concept is approved only if:
- All 9 criteria pass
- OR up to 2 criteria fail but have clear mitigation plans

If more than 2 criteria fail, the concept must be revised.

## Revision Triggers

If revising, focus on:
- **Tension alignment failure**: Make the strategic connection more explicit
- **CMO resonance failure**: Rewrite the hook with clearer business value
- **Differentiation failure**: Find a more distinctive angle
- **Entertainment value failure**: Add stronger audience hook
- **Format specificity failure**: Add more production detail
- **Sustainability failure**: Diversify episode concepts
- **Resource reality failure**: Scale down complexity
- **Brand integration failure**: Adjust brand role/presence
- **Platform fit failure**: Adapt format to platform norms
